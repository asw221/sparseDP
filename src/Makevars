## With OpenMP:
PKG_CXXFLAGS = -Wno-ignored-attributes -DNDEBUG -O3 -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -lomp -std=c++17

## If the package does not compile out of the box on your system, your compiler
## may not support OpenMP. Try removing the OpenMP preprocessor directives by
## commenting out the line above, and uncommenting the line below. The program may
## not run quite as fast, but output should be the same. The 2017 C++ standard is
## necessary to get the full functionality of the <random> library.

## Without OpenMP:
## PKG_CXXFLAGS = -Wno-ignored-attributes -DNDEBUG -O3 -std=c++17
